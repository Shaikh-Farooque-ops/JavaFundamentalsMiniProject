# ☕ Java Fundamentals Mini Projects

Welcome to the **Java Fundamentals Playground** — a curated collection of beginner-friendly mini projects designed to strengthen your core Java skills, one logic at a time.

These projects are crafted **without any OOP concepts** to help you master the **real foundation of Java** — variables, conditions, loops, arrays, and I/O. Perfect for those just starting their journey in programming.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧮 **Student Grade Calculator** | Enter marks for 5 subjects and calculate percentage and grade. |
| 💰 **Simple Interest & EMI Calculator** | Compute interest or EMI using basic arithmetic formulas. |
| 🔢 **Number Guessing Game** | Guess the number randomly generated by the program. |
| 🏧 **Basic ATM Simulation** | Simulate ATM operations — check balance, withdraw, deposit. |
| 🔠 **Word Counter** | Count the number of words in a user-entered sentence. |
| 📝 **Mini Quiz App** | Answer 5 MCQs and get scored at the end. |
| ➗ **Basic Calculator (Menu Driven)** | Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. |

> All projects are **terminal-based** and focus solely on building **logic** using **Core Java** constructs.

## 📎 Note
These projects are written without using any Object-Oriented Programming concepts intentionally — to help beginners master the basics of Java before diving deeper into OOP and frameworks.
Because building logic is the first step to becoming a great programmer. Before jumping into OOP, Spring Boot, or building REST APIs, it’s important to develop muscle memory for solving small problems.

These mini-projects are short, practical, and fun — your building blocks for bigger Java adventures! 🎯
